# Fun-With-C
Fun math programs I made while taking Introduction to Programming with C

Here are some math programs I had fun writing outside of class while taking my very first programming class. The most of these was definitely last_digit_of_a_power.c and nonrepeating_decimal_to_fraction.c because (1) it was cool to see how simple coding can make math and (2) the number theory behind finding the last digit of a power and turning decimals into fractions is just fascinating.

Looking back, I think I can make all of them more efficient somehow. I also remember considering making a program for turning *repeating* decimals into fractions, and I'm thinking of revisiting the math behind it; I just remember it was harder to understand at the time, but with my curiosity and greater mathematical maturity, I'll be able to figure it out. Stay tuned :)
